# 3D UNeXt for Brain Tumor Segmentation

This repository contains an implementation of **3D UNeXt**, a lightweight and efficient deep learning architecture for **3D medical image segmentation**, designed for tasks such as **brain tumor detection and segmentation** on volumetric datasets (e.g., BraTS 2021/2023).

The model integrates:
- **U-Net style encoderâ€“decoder** with skip connections  
- **UNeXt blocks** for efficient convolution + MLP style mixing  
- **Residual 3D convolutions** for feature extraction
